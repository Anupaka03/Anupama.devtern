# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various medical attributes. The dataset used contains several features related to heart health, and logistic regression is employed to create a predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Heart Disease dataset. It includes the following columns:

age: Age of the patient
sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (0-3)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence; 0 = absence)

## Results
The logistic regression model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results will be displayed in the terminal after running the evaluation script.
